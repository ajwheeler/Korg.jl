Continuous integration on github will ensure that the documentation is generated without errors, but it won't catch all formatting problems.  If you wish to generate documentation locally in order to check that everything is as expected, start a Julia session in Korg/docs, activate the test environment (]activate .), and run instantiate.

According to Rybicki & Lightman (2004) the free-free absorption coefficient (corrected for stimulated emission) is:\n\n    α = coef * Z² * ne * ni * (1 - exp(-hplanck*ν/(kboltz*T))) * g_ff / (sqrt(T) * ν³)\n\nNote that the g_ff is the free-free gaunt factor and coef is ∼3.7e8 (a more exact coefficient can be computed from eqn 5.18a).\n\nWith this in mind, equation 5.8 of Kurucz (1970) should actually read\n\n    κ = ne * n(H II) * F_ν(T) * (1 - exp(-hplanck*ν/(kboltz*T))) / ρ\n\nwhere Fν(T) = coef * Z² * gff / (sqrt(T) * ν³).\n\nSee gaunt_ff_vanHoof for details about where our gaunt factor data comes from. For simplicity, we enforce temperature and ν bounds constraints that don't include all of the available gaunt factor data. In practice, this should never be a concern for stellar spectroscopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"API/#Statistical-mechanics","page":"Function Reference","title":"Statistical mechanics","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"API/","page":"Function Reference","title":"Function Reference","text":"These functions can be used to calculate the number densities of all species in a given atospheric  layer, or other statmech calculations.

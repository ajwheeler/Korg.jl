This directory contained pre-processed cross-sections from TOPBase and NORAD.  Running the command
julia save_interpolated_cross-sections.jl path/to/Korg_data
produces the file bf_cross-sections.h5, which is used by Korg.

To keep package size down, Korg_data is in a separate repo, here: https://github.com/ajwheeler/Korg_data

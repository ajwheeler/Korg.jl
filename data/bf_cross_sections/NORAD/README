These files are nearly identical in format to the ones in the sibling "TOPBase" directory. See that 
README for details.

Note that the electron number in each file is that of the _resultant_ state, i.e. it's 1 less than
in the files in the "TOPBase" directory. Korg uses the filenames, which have been changed to match 
the TOPBase files, and ignores this number.

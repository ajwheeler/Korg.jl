This data was downloaded from TOPBase: http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/topbase/ftp.html
They originally had ".gz" extensions, despite being plain text, so I changed them to ".dat".

The filenames have the format [efp].<atomic number>.<ionization number>.dat.
"e" -> energy levels
"f" -> f values
"p" -> photoionization cross-sections

For example, "p26.02.dat" contains cross-section data for Fe II.

We only use the cross-section files.

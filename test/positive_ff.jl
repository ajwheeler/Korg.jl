    # Tables IV-XXIV of Peach 1970 lists "absorption coefficient" from bound-free absorption and
    # the combined coefficient from both bound-free + free-free absorption per ion (for the .
    # This function returns an arbitrary subset from that table that is used to check the accuracy
    # of our free-free absorption calculation. Tabulated ref data from Peach (1970) is provided in 
    # the form (α includes stim emission):
    # k = α(ν, T, ndens_H_II, nₑ)/((1 - exp(-h*ν / (k*T)) * ndens_He_I)
    #
    # Specifically, this function returns data for He I ff absorption from Table IV. This returns
    # the absorption coefficient in cm² per He I atom (it's not a typo that this is per He I, not
    # per He II). The data excludes the correction for stimulated emission.
    #
    # There is way more data in the table that could be used for self-consistency checks, but the
    # format seems difficult to digitize, so we use only a few rows from the He II table.

    # the participating species and partition func, plus the wavelengths, temps, and k vals for 
    # He I ff from Peach. Testing heavier elements is more complicated because Peach's and our
    # partition funcs don't match, though in principal we could reconstruct hers by using the energy
    # levels in Table I of Peach 1970.

                         partition_fns, log_equilibrium_constants; x0=nothing)

Iteratively solve for the number density of each species. Returns a pair containing the electron
number density and `Dict` mapping species to number densities.

arguments:

  - the temperature, `T`, in K
  - the total number density `nₜ`
  - the electron number density `nₑ`
  - A Dict of `absolute_abundances`, N_X/N_total
  - a Dict of ionization energies, `ionization_energies`.  The keys of act as a list of all atoms.
  - a Dict of partition functions, `partition_fns`
  - a Dict of log molecular equilibrium constants, `log_equilibrium_constants`, in partial pressure form.
    The keys of `equilibrium_constants` act as a list of all molecules.

keyword arguments:

  - `x0` (default: `nothing`) is an initial guess for the solution (in the format internal to
    `chemical_equilibrium`). If not supplied, a good guess is computed by neglecting molecules.
  - `electron_number_density_warn_threshold` (default: `0.1`) is the fractional difference between
    the calculated electron number density and the model atmosphere electron number density at which
    a warning is issued.
  - `electron_number_density_warn_min_value` (default: `1e-4`) is the minimum value of the electron
    number density at which a warning is issued.  This is to avoid warnings when the electron number
    density is very small.
  - `method` (default: `:adaptive`) is the solver method to use. Options are `:newton`, `:trust_region`,
    or `:adaptive`. The `:adaptive` method first attempts to solve with Newton's method (which is faster
    when it converges), and falls back to the trust region method if Newton fails.

The system of equations is specified with the number densities of the neutral atoms as free
parameters.  Each equation specifies the conservation of a particular species, e.g. (simplified)

    n(O) = n(CO) + n(OH) + n(O I) + n(O II) + n(O III).

In this equation:

  - `n(O)`, the number density of oxygen atoms in any form comes `absolute_abundances` and the total
    number density (supplied later)
  - `n(O I)` is a free parameter.  The numerical solver is varying this to satisfy the system of
    equations.
  - `n(O II)`, and `n(O III)` come from the Saha (ionization) equation given `n(O I)`
  - `n(CO)` and `n(OH)` come from the molecular equilibrium constants K, which are precomputed
    over a range of temperatures.

Equilibrium constants are defined in terms of partial pressures, so e.g.

    K(OH)  ==  (p(O) p(H)) / p(OH)  ==  (n(O) n(H)) / n(OH)) kT

The expression for w is in equation 4.71 of H&M.  K, the QM correction used in defined in equation 4.24.
Note that H&M's "N"s are numbers (not number densities), and their "V" is volume.  These quantities
apear only in the form N/V, so we use the number densities instead.

This is based partially on Paul Barklem and Kjell Eriksson's
[WCALC fortran routine](https://github.com/barklem/hlinop/blob/master/hbop.f)
(part of HBOP.f), which is used by (at least) Turbospectrum and SME.  As in that routine, we do
consider hydrogen and helium as the relevant neutral species, and assume them to be in the ground
state.  All ions are assumed to have charge 1.  Unlike that routine, the generalization to the
formalism from Hubeny+ 1994 is turned off by default because I haven't closely checked it.  The
difference effects the charged_term only, and temperature is only used when
`use_hubeny_generalization` is set to `true`.

    prune_linelist(atm, linelist, A_X, wls...; threshold=1.0, sort=true, synthesis_kwargs...)

Return the vector containing the strongest lines in `linelist`, (optionally) sorted by approximate
equivalent width.

# Arguments

  - `atm`: the atmosphere model
  - `linelist`: the linelist (a vector of `Line` objects)
  - `A_X`: the abundance of each element (see [`format_A_X`](@ref))
  - `wls...`: the wavelength ranges to synthesize over. These are specified the same way as the
    `wls` for [`synthesize`](@ref).

# Keyword Arguments

  - `threshold=0.1`: The threshold ratio in the line center absorption to the continuum absorption
    computed at the photosphere for a line to be included in the returned list.
    `0.1` is a reasonable default for getting a sense of what might be measurable in a high-res,
    high-quality spectrum, but it should not be used to create a linelist for synthesis.
  - `sort_by_EW=true`: If `true`, the returned linelist will be sorted by approximate reduced equivalent
    width. If `false`, the linelist will be in wavelength order. Leaving the list in wavelength
    order is much faster, but sorting by strength is useful for visualizing the strongest lines.
  - `verbose=true`: If `true`, a progress bar will be displayed while measuring the EWs.
    All other kwargs are passed to internal calls to [`synthesize`](@ref).
  - `max_distance=0.0`: how far from `wls` lines can be (in Å) before they are excluded from the
    returned list.

!!! caution

    While this function can be used to prune a linelist for synthesis, the default behavior is too
    aggressive for this purpose. Set a much lower threshold (e.g. `threshold=1e-4`) and use
    `sort_by_EW=false` if you are pruning the linelist to speedup synthesis. Note that Korg will
    dynamically choose which lines to include even if you use a large linelist (see
    the `line_cutoff_threshold` keyword argument to [`synthesize`](@ref)).

See also [`merge_close_lines`](@ref) if you are using this for plotting.

    merge_close_lines(linelist; merge_distance=0.2)

Produce a list of the species and wavelengths of the lines in `linelist`, merging lines of the same
species that are within `merge_distance` (default: 0.2 Å). This is useful for labeling lines in a
plot after running [`prune_linelist`](@ref).

# Arguments

  - `linelist`: the linelist (a vector of `Line` objects)

# Keyword Arguments

  - `merge_distance=0.2`: The maximum distance in Å between lines of the same species to be merged
    into a single entry

# Returns

A vector of tuples `(wl, wl_low, wl_high, species)` where `wl` is the gf-weighted wavelength of each set
of merged lines (Å), `wl_low` and `wl_high` are their highest and lowest wavelength, and
`species` is a string (not a `Korg.Species`) identifying the species of the line. These will be in
wavelength order.
